    question: "What payment processors does InvoiceZap support?",
    answer: "InvoiceZap supports ANY payment processor that provides a payment link or URL. This includes all major providers like Stripe, PayPal, Square, Wise, and many more. You simply paste your payment link, and we'll include it in your invoice."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need a Stripe account to use InvoiceZap?",
    answer: "No! While we offer automatic Stripe integration, you can use any payment processor you prefer. Simply choose 'Custom Payment Link' and paste your PayPal.me, Square, or any other payment URL."
  },
  {
    question: "How do custom payment links work?",
    answer: "When you choose a custom payment link, you paste your payment URL (like paypal.me/yourname) and customize the button text. This link is then included in your PDF invoice and email, making it easy for clients to pay through your preferred method."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I use different payment methods for different clients?",
    answer: "Absolutely! You can choose different payment options for each invoice. Use Stripe for some clients, PayPal for others, or even send invoice-only for clients who prefer traditional payment methods."
  },
  {
    question: "What if my payment processor isn't listed above?",
    answer: "If your payment processor provides a payment link or URL, it will work with InvoiceZap! Our system is designed to work with any payment service that generates shareable payment links."
  },
  {
    question: "Are there any fees for using custom payment links?",
    answer: "InvoiceZap doesn't charge any fees for using custom payment links. You'll only pay the fees charged by your chosen payment processor (PayPal, Stripe, etc.)."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I use cryptocurrency payment processors?",
    answer: "Yes! Any crypto payment processor that provides payment links will work, including Coinbase Commerce, BitPay, and others."
  },
  {
    question: "How secure are the payment links?",
    answer: "Payment links are as secure as the processor that generates them. All major payment processors use bank-level security and encryption to protect transactions."
